# Terraform AWS Multi-Environment Infrastructure

This project demonstrates how to provision and manage a multi-environment infrastructure on AWS using **Terraform**.  
It follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices by using a **modular architecture** to create reusable components for networking and compute, which are then deployed into separate **staging** and **production** environments.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project is structured to separate reusable components from environment-specific configurations, promoting a clean and scalable design.

- **/modules**: Contains reusable, generic Terraform configurations for individual AWS components.  
  - **/network/aws**: A module to create a foundational network, including a VPC, public subnet, internet gateway, route table, and a security group.  
  - **/compute/aws**: A module to launch an EC2 instance, complete with a `user_data` script to bootstrap a simple web server.  

- **/stacks**: Contains the deployable configurations for each environment. Each stack calls the necessary modules and provides environment-specific variables.  
  - **/staging**: A configuration for a testing environment.  
  - **/production**: A configuration for a production environment.  

This structure allows for **consistent deployments** across different environments while managing their configurations independently.
